            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language.
                Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                its
                environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language
                elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");</code>

            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                Document
                Object Model (DOM). </li>

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <p>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");</code>
            <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main
                page about JavaScript.</li>

            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming</p>
            <p>onventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                JavaScript.</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");</code>
            <li>n contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations,</li>

            <p>. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                objects. </p>
            <p>JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be
                properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");</code>
            <li>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. You do </li>

            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p> JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                characters "A" through "Z" (uppe</p>

            greetMe("World");</code>
            <li>ou can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
                escape sequence</li>
